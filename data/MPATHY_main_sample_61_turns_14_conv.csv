MPATHY-000001-0000,Speaker,"I remember going to see the fireworks with my best friend. It was the first time we ever spent time alone together. Although there was a lot of people, we felt like the only people in the world."
MPATHY-000001-0001,Listener,"Was this a friend you were in love with, or just a best friend?"

MPATHY-000005-0001,Speaker,Don't be nervous. Just be prepared.
MPATHY-000005-0002,Listener,I feel like getting prepared and then having a curve ball thrown at you throws you off. 
MPATHY-000005-0003,Speaker,Yes but if you stay calm it will be ok.
MPATHY-000005-0004,Listener,It's hard to stay clam. How do you do it?
