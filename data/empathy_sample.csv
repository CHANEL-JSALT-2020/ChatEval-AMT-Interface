MPATHY-000000-0000,Speaker,I remember going to see the fireworks with my best friend. It was the first time we ever spent time alone together. Although there was a lot of people_comma_ we felt like the only people in the world.;

MPATHY-000029-0003,Speaker,I can understand. I am not a big drinker myself_comma_ but I wouldn't feel guilty about it.  Not unless you promised someone you wouldn't drink.;

MPATHY-000040-0006,Speaker,I think at 3am the mind is truly it's sharpest and can make great content. I do understand the age thing though. Maybe slowly give her more time as she gets older. At 15 to 16 it gets hard to control all together.;
