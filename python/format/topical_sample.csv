TPCCHT-000002-2,agent_1,agreed the google headquarters in mountain view california is nicknamed the google plex

TPCCHT-000002-5,agent_2,say what now they have that
TPCCHT-000002-6,agent_1,yeah apparently lol they do that instead of hiring people to mow
TPCCHT-000002-7,agent_2,thats both funny and i guess imaginative leave it to a huge tech company to employ actual goats
TPCCHT-000002-8,agent_1,yeah exactly i am sure they are cheaper one thing i bet they couldnt exploit is fish i think fish are so cool there is actually a breed of jellyfish that is immortal
TPCCHT-000002-9,agent_2,i had rememered hearing about that before immortatlity is wasted on a jellyfish haha did you know a seahorse is the only fish that has an actual neck
TPCCHT-000002-10,agent_1,that is so funny i guess i never considered a seahorse a fish the black swallower fish sounds a lot like a snake because it can eat pray that is so large
TPCCHT-000002-11,agent_2,i guess they live up to their name then
TPCCHT-000002-12,agent_1,it seems they do i also didnt know that there was a difference with how freshwater and saltwater fish drink
TPCCHT-000002-13,agent_2,thats crazy i wonder why fresh water ones only use osmosis
TPCCHT-000002-14,agent_1,yeah and saltwater fish are lucky because they can do that and drink through their mouths
TPCCHT-000002-15,agent_2,seems like fresh water fish got the short end of the stick with that one have you ever been to a cat cafe
TPCCHT-000002-16,agent_1,i have never been to a cat cafe no what about you seems like they are popular in japan and taiwan
TPCCHT-000002-17,agent_2,no but i would love to paying hourly to hang out with adorable cats im in

TPCCHT-000003-2,agent_1,i am really bad but it is a good time
TPCCHT-000003-3,agent_2,dancing is a lot of fun did you know that bruce lee was a great dancer
TPCCHT-000003-4,agent_1,i heard that winning cha cha championships and everything
TPCCHT-000003-5,agent_2,yes that is amazing he won the hong kong chacha championship back in 1958 in fact
TPCCHT-000003-6,agent_1,i always just thought of him as a martial arts legend now he is a dance legend of sorts too
TPCCHT-000003-7,agent_2,yeah that is correct he was a fantastic martial artist did you know that tupac danced ballet in high school
TPCCHT-000003-8,agent_1,yeah he was the mouse king in the nutcracker thats pretty cool i would definitely never have guessed that about him
TPCCHT-000003-9,agent_2,neither did i that is insane because tupac was a famous rapper

TPCCHT-000003-12,agent_1,sure thing did you hear about michael jacksons special patent shoes
TPCCHT-000003-13,agent_2,no i know that michael jackson was a fantastic dancer but can you tell me more about his patent shoes if you dont mind
TPCCHT-000003-14,agent_1,there was a specific device in his shoes that helped with his extreme lean in some dance moves
TPCCHT-000003-15,agent_2,wow that is amazing coming from such a talented singer and dancer i couldnt even dance like that even if i dreamed of it
TPCCHT-000003-16,agent_1,me neither i could never be a professional dancer
TPCCHT-000003-17,agent_2,i heard that some professional ballet dancer can go through four pairs of shoes in a week
TPCCHT-000003-18,agent_1,that is crazy that cant be cheap for them
TPCCHT-000003-19,agent_2,no i think its very expensive for them to be professional ballet dancers based on this
TPCCHT-000003-20,agent_1,it has been great chatting but i must go gotta go get my bruce lee on the martial arts part definitely not the dance
TPCCHT-000003-21,agent_2,ha ha it was so nice chatting with you as well have a nice day bye

TPCCHT-000004-4,agent_1,yes they go through 4 pairs in a single week

TPCCHT-000004-10,agent_1,yeah do you like shakespeare
TPCCHT-000004-11,agent_2,i love his work did you know he popularized many terms that we use to this day
TPCCHT-000004-12,agent_1,yes terms like good riddance in my heart of heart and such
TPCCHT-000004-13,agent_2,yes he lives at the same time as pocahontas did
TPCCHT-000004-14,agent_1,i wonder if they had met what he would have written about her
TPCCHT-000004-15,agent_2,yeah good point he also invented some womens names
TPCCHT-000004-16,agent_1,yes among those are olivia miranda and jessica
TPCCHT-000004-17,agent_2,yeah did you know that his works have to stick to the old english language to make sense
TPCCHT-000004-18,agent_1,yes especially with punk and rhymes they do not work with modern language
TPCCHT-000004-19,agent_2,yeah did you know tchaikozsky donated his skull in hopes it will be used in shakespeares plays
TPCCHT-000004-20,agent_1,yes and did get used so that is good nice chat
TPCCHT-000005-0,agent_1,hi do you use google much
TPCCHT-000005-1,agent_2,yes i think it is the most effective search engine how about you do you use gmail
TPCCHT-000005-2,agent_1,yes a google search takes more computing power than sending astronauts tot he moon
TPCCHT-000005-3,agent_2,and before on google moon they used to use cheese for close ups
TPCCHT-000005-4,agent_1,do you know how google maps calculates traffic
TPCCHT-000005-5,agent_2,i am not sure how do they do this
TPCCHT-000005-6,agent_1,they track how fast android devices are moving
TPCCHT-000005-7,agent_2,interesting google really is taking over the world their data center electricity use is 001 percent of all worldwide electricity
TPCCHT-000005-8,agent_1,yes for sure they are they have grown so much over the years
TPCCHT-000005-9,agent_2,but i like that they like to have fun too have you ever typed askew into google
TPCCHT-000005-10,agent_1,no i have what does the results turn
TPCCHT-000005-11,agent_2,you should try it it tilts the page another fun thing google does is call new employees nogglers they have to wear propeller beanies or is this mean
TPCCHT-000005-12,agent_1,oh not sure about that really people say it is a great place to work at though
TPCCHT-000005-13,agent_2,before google launched gmail that was the name of a free email service offered by garfields website that actually seems more fun
TPCCHT-000005-14,agent_1,i know now everytime i open gmail i think of garfield
TPCCHT-000005-15,agent_2,speaking of cats i would love to get a glow in the dark one they have those in south korea
TPCCHT-000005-16,agent_1,wow in japana and taiwan there are cat cafes where you can play with them
TPCCHT-000005-17,agent_2,that seems fun that reminds me of the anderson house bed and breakfast in minnesota they used to offer a free cat for the night when you booked a room
TPCCHT-000005-18,agent_1,wow there is a town in alaska where the mayor of the town is a cat
TPCCHT-000005-19,agent_2,that is cool cats are a pretty smart species there has not been a cat species extinction in 10000 years
TPCCHT-000005-20,agent_1,they are indeed very smart and that proves it nice chatting with you
TPCCHT-000006-0,agent_1,do you like comic books
TPCCHT-000006-1,agent_2,i do like comic books
TPCCHT-000006-2,agent_1,have you heard that harley quinn has a new comic book series coming out
TPCCHT-000006-3,agent_2,i have not heard that i know that comic book legend stan lee used to end every phone conversation with excelsior
TPCCHT-000006-4,agent_1,ive heard that too did you know that the dc in dc comics stands for detective comics
TPCCHT-000006-5,agent_2,i just read that today the largest comic book market is in japan i believe it my son loves to read those mangas
TPCCHT-000006-6,agent_1,i would love to go there i used to like reading manga too
TPCCHT-000006-7,agent_2,the manga market is japan is valued at 6 to 7 billion dollars
TPCCHT-000006-8,agent_1,that is wild did you know that michigan state university library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world
TPCCHT-000006-9,agent_2,i didnt know that i wonder how many people use it by comparison to japan the us comic book market in the us and canada is 109 billion
TPCCHT-000006-10,agent_1,thats crazy japan is way more into comic books than america it seems
TPCCHT-000006-11,agent_2,i agree the marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth 199999 a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse earth616
TPCCHT-000006-12,agent_1,thats pretty wild marvel published a generic comic book in order to trademark the names superhero and supervillain that was pretty smart of them
TPCCHT-000006-13,agent_2,no doubt do you know much about the planets or the universe
TPCCHT-000006-14,agent_1,i know a little bit ive heard that venus does not tilt
TPCCHT-000006-15,agent_2,that interesting uranus is different to it actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spins like the other planets
TPCCHT-000006-16,agent_1,thats really interesting ive also heard that jupiters moon ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun
TPCCHT-000006-17,agent_2,it must be pretty big then i wouldnt want to ever visit the unnamed planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph
TPCCHT-000006-18,agent_1,i dont see that being a pleasant place its even 2000 degree weather that sounds like hell to me
TPCCHT-000006-19,agent_2,hahah thats a good way of putting it
TPCCHT-000006-20,agent_1,well i have to get to work i hope you have a good day it was nice chatting with you
TPCCHT-000007-0,agent_1,can you believe there is stars that can be cold enough to be touched the universe is so diverse
TPCCHT-000007-1,agent_2,its amazing and ever evolving
TPCCHT-000007-2,agent_1,yeah and there is even places that exist but we never will be able to see because they are too far away
TPCCHT-000007-3,agent_2,they are saying space pulls galaxies outside of universe that we could see
TPCCHT-000007-4,agent_1,yes that is what i was saying albeit i doubt that there is only one electron in the universe like some people say
TPCCHT-000007-5,agent_2,i dont see anything supporting or denying that theory so we would never know for sure
TPCCHT-000007-6,agent_1,yeah but only one for all the universe it does not seems logic
TPCCHT-000007-7,agent_2,there is only one sun that warms earth and all other planets so why not just one electron
TPCCHT-000007-8,agent_1,because an electron is part of matter the water you drink the chair you sit on saying there is only 1 electron in the universe is like saying there is 1 grain of wheat in your bread
TPCCHT-000007-9,agent_2,it makes sense when you put it that way but in terms of that universe size the electron could be very big
TPCCHT-000007-10,agent_1,maybe they did mean to say that our universe is contained in an electron in another universe
TPCCHT-000007-11,agent_2,i dont know but i am at the end of knowledge on this subject what do you think about the facts of comics i would have thought us invented them but its japan or uk
TPCCHT-000007-12,agent_1,japan has a great printing history i am not surprised about this do you read comics books i have read a few but not about superheroes
TPCCHT-000007-13,agent_2,i used to in my childhood but not any more i used to love inspector gadget
TPCCHT-000007-14,agent_1,was inspect gadget a comics on paper or a cartoon on tv i was talking about what marvel is publishing
TPCCHT-000007-15,agent_2,on paper and yes i do recall seeing superhero and hulk books
TPCCHT-000007-16,agent_1,i think that hulk is in the marvel universe but like i said i never read anything from marvel nor dc comics
TPCCHT-000007-17,agent_2,right me neither there were so many good choices of comics when i was growing up
TPCCHT-000007-18,agent_1,not where i lived if i want to read a comic book i had to go to the library but as i think about it tintin is a comic book so i was wrong i did read a lot of them when i was young but they were european
TPCCHT-000007-19,agent_2,mine all time favorite was bozo the clown books and tv both
TPCCHT-000007-20,agent_1,i did saw a lot of cartoons on tv but i dont think that considered as a comic book have a nice day
TPCCHT-000008-0,agent_1,are you a star wars fan i need to rewatch the ot and the prequels so i can watch the subsequent stuff for the first time and understand whats going on
TPCCHT-000008-1,agent_2,hi yes i am a huge fan of star wars i also loved how it was the first major movie to be dubbed in navajo i think that is so cool
TPCCHT-000008-2,agent_1,yeah thats wild i guess it takes a pretty small audience to pay for the translation work
TPCCHT-000008-3,agent_2,agreed isnt it also funny james earl jones only spent two and half hours recording his lines for darth vader i also cant believe he was only paid 7500 geez thats pocket change
TPCCHT-000008-4,agent_1,7500 is amazingly low i guess since darth vader was masked jones could just record everything at once in the studio
TPCCHT-000008-5,agent_2,agreed can you also believe that george lucas wife at the time marcia won an academy award for her editing on star wars and yet george lucas didnt win an academy award for directing that is just downright unbelievable
TPCCHT-000008-6,agent_1,a lot of people think the ot was so much better than the prequels because of her influence
TPCCHT-000008-7,agent_2,yeah it was because of her that so many major changes were made like leias good luck kiss obi wans death etc she was truly a big influence
TPCCHT-000008-8,agent_1,i remember thinking just about everything in the prequels timeline was off based on the mental version of the past the ot led us to construct but id have to rewatch to nail it down
TPCCHT-000008-9,agent_2,yeah i would have to watch it as well so are you also a fan of chewbacca i love him i think its funny theres a bat species called the chewbacca bat thats hilarious
TPCCHT-000008-10,agent_1,i never felt strongly about chewbacca one way or the other tbh but ive got to google a picture of that bat to see what it looks like
TPCCHT-000008-11,agent_2,i would like to see it as well did you know chewbacca actually had a wife and two boys thats pretty interesting
TPCCHT-000008-12,agent_1,i vaguely recall reading something in the star wars fictional universe where a young han solo stayed with chewbacca and his mom in their home
TPCCHT-000008-13,agent_2,thats so weird isnt it ha are you one of the fans who believes both r2d2 and chewbacca were secret rebel agents i kind of think its an interesting theory
TPCCHT-000008-14,agent_1,i wish i knew enough about the background to have an opinion but the last star wars i watched was episode iii when it came out on video i really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it
TPCCHT-000008-15,agent_2,same here like i also had forgotten that before his companionship with chewbacca hans solo was an imperial lieutenant
TPCCHT-000008-16,agent_1,yeah i dont remember that at all he definitely doesnt seem like the type
TPCCHT-000008-17,agent_2,indeed he doesnt but ive always liked chewbacca because he reminded me of a giant dog ha speaking of dogs i think its cool that dogs along with elephants are the only animals that understand pointing
TPCCHT-000008-18,agent_1,i wouldnt be surprised if cats understood it but just didnt care lol
TPCCHT-000008-19,agent_2,ha no kidding speaking of dogs and cats i like how google prefers dogs over cats and even states in their code of conduct that theyre a dog company that is awesome
TPCCHT-000008-20,agent_1,yeah thats a weird official policy for whats supposed to be a neutral search engine nice chatting with you
TPCCHT-000009-0,agent_1,naming a cloned cat copy cat thats cute
TPCCHT-000009-1,agent_2,you must have esp i was going to tell you teh same thing i have a sad story to tell there are less tigers living in the wild in asia than as pets in the us
TPCCHT-000009-2,agent_1,really thats awful to hear
TPCCHT-000009-3,agent_2,of roosevelts 20 pets two were a bear and hyena
TPCCHT-000009-4,agent_1,whoa cool i know he seemed to be quite the animal lover
TPCCHT-000009-5,agent_2,and there are more pets in japan than there are children under 15 you cant be a pets owner in boulder but you can be their guardian
TPCCHT-000009-6,agent_1,i have a pet i am an ailurophile meaning i love cats
TPCCHT-000009-7,agent_2,cool word did you know there are 20 quintillion animal varieties on earth
TPCCHT-000009-8,agent_1,that is a lot and in 2002 germany gave them legal rights
TPCCHT-000009-9,agent_2,yeah and the loch ness monster is protected under the 1912 scottish animal protection act
TPCCHT-000009-10,agent_1,i wonder if the immortal jellyfish needs protecting being immortal and all
TPCCHT-000009-11,agent_2,lolspeaking of water animals did you know that hiccoughs are a left over from evolution when we had gills
TPCCHT-000009-12,agent_1,maybe that connection is part of why 84 of human disease genes have counterparts in zebrafish too hmm
TPCCHT-000009-13,agent_2,hmm good theory seeing that the most popular pets are cats and dogs it is no surprise that they are commonly used for therapy in hospitals
TPCCHT-000009-14,agent_1,well they are good at helping people adjust to new situations too
TPCCHT-000009-15,agent_2,yes like for elderly who are without companions
TPCCHT-000009-16,agent_1,or people with anxiety and depression or kids with autism
TPCCHT-000009-17,agent_2,yes a seahorse wouldnt be very good for that purpose did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck
TPCCHT-000009-18,agent_1,i dont think a black swallower fish would be good as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length
TPCCHT-000009-19,agent_2,that would freak me out but i bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication
TPCCHT-000009-20,agent_1,could be fish are cool like that i think its neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish
TPCCHT-000009-21,agent_2,i wonder if reptiles are considered ectothermic like most fish
TPCCHT-000009-22,agent_1,that would be a good thing to know especially because some of them make good pets
TPCCHT-000009-23,agent_2,yep but i dont know if walking a gecko would give the same health benefits as walking a dog
TPCCHT-000009-24,agent_1,probably not dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time
TPCCHT-000009-25,agent_2,hey did you know the first marine predator was the shark they developed in the silurian period
TPCCHT-000009-26,agent_1,very interesting i wonder how many aquatic species have gone extinct since then
TPCCHT-000009-27,agent_2,or have evolved into other species the shark has a higher core temperature than other fish because it is an active swimmer
TPCCHT-000009-28,agent_1,that makes sense i always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone
TPCCHT-000009-29,agent_2,yes fascinating fact tuna also hold a higher core temperature they are in the same class as shark because they are also active swimmers
TPCCHT-000009-30,agent_1,tuna can get quite large too its cool how big some fish get
TPCCHT-000009-31,agent_2,one more before we godid you know domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead
TPCCHT-000009-32,agent_1,yeah that is a pretty cool way to know they are domesticated rather than wild
TPCCHT-000009-33,agent_2,very cool chatting with you did you know there are 6331 groups of genes they are common to all living animals
TPCCHT-000009-34,agent_1,it was a cool exercise in zoology chatting with you
